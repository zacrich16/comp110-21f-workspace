# The Case of the Kidnapped Kaki

Welcome to a supplemental COMP110 epic mystery halloween adventure!!! Right off the bat, note that this is NOT a graded assignment for the class. This adventure is for those seeking a little spooky challenge outside of the normal duties of a COMP110’er.

In this project, you will use your programming skills to deduce clues and explore UNC’s campus in search of QR codes that will take you through each part of the mystery.

If you dare to embark upon this spooky challenge, continue here: <https://21f.comp110.com/mystery/>
